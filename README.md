- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @CocoWantsACake
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m into anything that can be done with a computer, such as ... Coding, playing video games, watching videos and memes! I'm also in love with mechanical things, such as cars, motorbikes...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning computer sciences at the university of Orsay, in France. I'm already planning on going to bigger universities once my 2 years course is done.
- ðŸ“« If you have any question, or the urge to play LoL with someone, add CocoVeutUnGateau#7606 on discord!
